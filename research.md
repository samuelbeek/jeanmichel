# Research 

## How to do the backend
I think there's a few lean approaches here:
* Scrape certain reddit threads for audio/podcast links
* Create a soundcloud account that follows these podcasts, load that data into the app (more of a hack, but hey, we're talking lean here)
* Work with RSS and scrape links there

## Content
I'm making a moderate list of podcasts to start with. I might wanna scrape Reddit or other websites.
